A PowerShell module for learning to use objects and also for the new class command of version 5.0

This module is for PowerShell newbies that might struggle to understand the concept of objects but also for experienced PowerShell users who are looking for a good example that makes use of the class command that was introduced with Version 5.0

I am doing a lot of PowerShell trainings and would like to use this module for my training classes.
